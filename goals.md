-EDA
  total AWO amount/awo-npsr percentage by service code
  total AWO amount/awo-npsr by NCI_transaction detail
    BOTH all hospitals and by individual hospital

  Keep titles/descriptions clear as we go

  Keep in mind features opportunities

-Unsupervised learning/clustering
  PCA -> to show difficulty
  KMeans clustering over all hospitals -> drop hospitals (mimic total system)
  KMeans clustering in each hospital
    -Inspect aspects of each cluster
  GMMs for soft clustering
    GMM pipeline with ML models

  keep description for methods clear


-Predictive modeling
  Start small - > linear regression, logistic regression (use VIF)

  ML models for regression (AWO amount OR awo/npsr percent)
                classification AWO buckets

-Timeline:
  Monday (1/14) EOD: Finish all EDA
  Friday (1/16) EOD: Clustering complete
  Following: Brainstorm and complete ML models
